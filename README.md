#Highlight GOV.UK in search results

This is a browser extension for Google Chrome, to highlight GOV.UK search results in Google and Bing.

It highlights links in different colours by URL, so that you can easily see which results are from GOV.UK and which part of the site they're from:

- Yellow: services and information
- Blue: navigation
- Green: departments and policy
- Grey: uploaded files

It also highlights some related URLs to help with the transition to the GOV.UK single domain:

- Orange: Directgov
- Dark green: Business Link
- Pink: National Archives web archive

##How to install it

You have to install this extension manually because it's not hosted on the official Google Chrome web store.

- Download [highlight-search-results.crx](https://github.com/tarastockford/highlight-search-results/raw/master/highlight-search-results.crx).
- Click 'Continue' if you see a security warning, and don't worry about the message saying 'Apps, extensions and user scripts cannot be added from this website'.
- Show the downloaded file in the Finder or Windows Explorer.
- Go to your Google Chrome Settings > Extensions.
- Drag the highlight-search-results.crx file from the Finder/Explorer window and drop it on to the Extensions window.
- Click 'Add' to confirm that you want to install it.
- You should see a message saying 'Highlight GOV.UK in search results has been added to Chrome'.

If you want to turn it off, go back to Settings > Extensions and untick the box next to 'Enabled' (or click the trash icon to remove it completely).
